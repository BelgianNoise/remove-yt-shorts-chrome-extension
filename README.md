# remove-yt-shorts-chrome-extension

This is a chrome extension that lets you hide YoutTube Shorts on your subscription page. I created this extension because I really don't want to be bethered with Shorts when I am looking through my subscriprions.

The latest version removed any shorts anywhere on the site but in the 'Shorts' tab.

I whipped this up in about an hour or two and I just needed it to work. I did not think about efficiency or coding standard at all since I didnt even write this in an IDE. This is my first ever chrome extension so it might not be up to recent standards.
